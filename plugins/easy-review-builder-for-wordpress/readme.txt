== Description ==

This lightweight plugin allows you to easily insert attractive star-based review summaries into your blog by way of shortcodes. The ratings box scales for mobile displays.  It supports multiple rating categories and an optional auto-calculated summary.  

PHP5 Required.

The shortcode format is:

**[easyreview argument="value" ...]**

With Easy Review Builder you can quickly generate a classy looking summary box.  It is flexible, with the ability for you to specify whatever review categories are important, such as "price", or "graphics", etc.  You also provide some text to summarize your thoughts on each review point, along with your final rating.

An optional conclusion will average the ratings specified.  You can provide a conclusion summary text as well.
